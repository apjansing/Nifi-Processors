I was not paid for these processors and I am offering them up to the open source community to do with them as they will. All work here has been and will be done on my own time and on my own hardware with no assets developed by my employer(s).


The processors provided here will use my [Nifi-Tools](https://github.com/apjansing/Nifi-Tools) methods for shorthand in manipulating Nifi FlowFiles and perform other actions. You will need to clone that repo and use it as a dependency if you want to make modifications to this repo. I will combine the projects at a later date.
